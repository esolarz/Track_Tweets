Databases:
full_db: A real time database of all of molly's tweets 
full_db_temp: a temporatry copy of full_db that is created at the end of the [period of time I have yet to decide on] so that full_db can still be added to as the comparison process is happening. This db is cleared at the end of the comparison so that I still have space left on my harddrive 
daily_db: The tweets that are still online after [period of time I have yet to decide on]. This is also cleared after the comparison is over to save space
deleted_db: the database of all deleted tweets. This is added to after the comparison
