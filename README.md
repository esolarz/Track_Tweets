#Tracking Deleted Tweets

This is a tool that can track deleted tweets and upload them to google drive

The account that it is set to is currently hardcoded in, this is by no means a finished project, and there is still plenty of work to be done. Unfortunately I have not had time to work on this throughout the school year, so progress has been at a halt for a while. 

The code needs a decent amount of work in order to be both generalized and optimized.
